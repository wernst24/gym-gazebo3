"""
Random agent test for TurtleBot3 with depth camera environment.

This demonstrates the single-line gymnasium.make() approach and matches
the target repository's environment structure.

Usage:
    # First, start Gazebo with TurtleBot3:
    ros2 launch gym_gazebo3 turtlebot3_camera_launch.py headless:=true
    
    # Then run this test:
    python3 examples/test_turtlebot3_camera_random.py
